Shmurho is a set of helper libraries for C++ development with Urho3D engine.

There are some high-level features, which are not provided (and/or should not be provided) by Urho3D itself
but are regularly useful in (my) Urho3D-based gamedev practice. One of Shmurho's goals is to provide these
features as small distinct libraries.

Libraries:

* __Phase__

 ShmurhoPhase library helps to orginize game/app with distinct phases (like
main menu phase, splash screen phase, game level phase, etc).

* __Preload__

 ShmurhoPreload library provides ability to background load resources lists
(parcels) and one-point interface for background loading resources and scenes.
Prefabs support and more background operations are planned.
